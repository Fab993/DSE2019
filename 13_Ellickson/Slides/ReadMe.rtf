\f0\fs24 \cf0 My plan is to spend most of my time on Sweeting (Ecma, 2013), the slides for which are titled DSEslides1.pdf.\
Time permitting (which it likely will not), I will highlight some additional concepts from Ellickson, Misra, Nair (JMR, 2012), the slides for which are titled DESslides2.pdf.\
Main point: if you are pressed for time, spend it reading the Sweeting paper.  }
